The current version of Rainloop contains a code vulnerability that can expose users emails to attackers.

For more information, please refer to:

- https://forum.yunohost.org/t/security-rainloop-suffers-a-security-bug/19579

We have implemented a patch in this YunoHost package to fix it.

However, since Rainloop's development has been halted for a year now, and since its developers
have yet to react to solve this critical flaw, we strongly encourage you to seek alternative
applications to replace Rainloop.
